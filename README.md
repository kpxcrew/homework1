## About
The Horiseon project is a demonstration site that showcases HTML and CSS. The site has a navigation bar at the top that showcase three specific topics when it comes to growing a business utilizing internet properties.   

HTML was used so that a site can be created. CSS was used to style the HTML since CSS essentially dictates how the HTML elements are to be displayed on a site.  

The problems I faced was understanding proper HTML semantics and the purpose of using more specific elements rather than a general element. I also experienced many typos, mainly having closed brackets and curly brackets.  


## Usage
Utilizing the site is simple! 

Load the site by copying and pasting the link on to a browser.
* 

Once open, click on any of the three topics in the navigation bar. The title will redirect you to the location on the page that porvides more information in respect to the subject.
